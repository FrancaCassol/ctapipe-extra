# ctapipe-extra
Extra files for ctapipe (test and example data, IPython notebooks)

This package contains a set of data files in a package called `ctapipe_resources` 
used internally by ctapipe for unit testing and configuration. 

This is a dependency of the ctapipe package, and will be installed automatically 
when ctapipe is installed.
